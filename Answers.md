## Questions
1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack** - LIFO - Last in first out.
   - **Queue** - FIFO - First in first out.

2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures? 
   - **Linked List** - O(n) Linear Time
   - **Hash Table** - O(1) Constant Time
   - **Binary Search Trees** - O(logn) Logarithmic Time

3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript? 
    - One of the biggest advantages is faster search and retrieval times.  Hash Tables, at their best, run in constant time because they insert and search through unique identifiers. Arrays, on the other hand, search in linear time and so can become unwieldly as they grow.
    - Building on the point above, Hash Tables generally scale pretty well. They can be expanded to accommodate increasing amounts of data (and collisions) without sacrificing speed (for the most part).  Again, arrays don't scale as efficiently.


I did my best deer in the headlights impression! Back to the drawing board.
